<h1>Joseph top movies list</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 2 movies that's are i seen in my last two days</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1st : Thudarum</h3>
<p>
  This is the one of the greatest thriller movies i loved it because the movie
  main character loves cars very much that all they show in first half but the
  second half it looks very different it completely a mind blowing movies i must
  recommend this to add it in your cart
</p>

<h3>2nd : Kanthara</h3>
<p>
  It a religious based movie it a good one but mainly i woukd recommend this
  movie for it's climax
